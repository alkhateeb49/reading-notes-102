## We have learned about JavaScript
* Conditionals
Very often when you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions.

* Operators
JavaScript includes operators as in other languages. An operator performs some operation on single or multiple operands (data value) and produces a result. For example 1 + 2, where + sign is an operator and 1 is left operand and 2 is right operand. + operator adds two numeric values and produces a result which is 3 in this case.

* Data Type
Three Data Types that are primitives, checked by typeof operator:
Boolean : typeof instance === "boolean"
Number : typeof instance === "number"
String : typeof instance === "string"

* Variables
Because it is a little complicated to describe the difference between these keywords, and because they are not supported in older browsers, the first part of this tutorial will most often use var.
