**This is what I leanred in class 102_03:**

* I learned that Git DVCS(Distributed Version Control systems), in short words it's a command tool used to communicate with GitHub for the purpose of:
  1. to track the changes in our code.
  2. share our code with others.
  3. and to team the developer who they are working on the same project.
  
* There are three stages that we pass by (**Git flow**):
  1. The actual files in your local pc, Here you intended to upload these files on Github. Use **git add .**
  2. Then you need to mark the changes that you did and make the code ready to be pushed to Github. Use **git -m "The message you want"**
  3. After that we need to push the code to Github (upload it). Use **git push origin main**
