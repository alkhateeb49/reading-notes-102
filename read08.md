**This is what I leanred in class 102_08:**


* We learned in class 8:

1. Comparison operators:
    * Greater than (**>**)
    * Less than (**<**)
    * Greater than or equal (**>=**)
    * Less than or equal (**<=**)
    * equal to (**==**)
    * not equal to (**!=**)
    * Strict equal (**===**)
    * Strict not equal (**!==**)

2. Logical operators:
    * and (**&&**)
    * or (**|**)
    * not (**!**)

3. The decision-making process has two components:
    * An expression that returns a value.
    * A Conditional statement.

4. Loops check a condition, if it's true the code will run then the condition with check again if it's true it will run the code again, it will continue repeating until the condition is false.

5. We have three types of loops:
    * FOR, Use it if you want to run code for a specific number of times.
    * WHILE, Use it if you don't know how many   times you want to run your code.
    * DO WHILE, same as WHILE but it different from WHILE it will run the code at least once before checking the condition.
